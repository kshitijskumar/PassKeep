# PassKeep
## Your own password manager

### Description:
In this online world, we have alot of accounts at various websites and it's not safe to keep all of their passwords safe but also easy to remember to all those passwords(atleast for me).
So PassKeep saves you from this. You can add website name, username, password in it. And what if you have to check your password in front of someone? While retrieving your data, you'll be only seeing website name and username, not the password, to see your password you've to tap that card and it'll expand with your password, this way the person peeking will only be able to see that particular password(which you can change later) and not all your passwords. It has a pin as well to safe your password details from others. All the data is stroed in an internal database.
